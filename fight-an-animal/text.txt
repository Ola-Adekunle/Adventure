** Snake **
    1 **
     The snake hisses, its forked tongue flicking out as it gauges your next move. The sunlight glints off its scales, highlighting its dangerous beauty. It's only a few feet away, and you can see the venom glistening on its fangs. You’re armed with a sturdy stick you picked up earlier.

    attack, 3 **
     With determination in your eyes, you tighten your grip on the stick and take aim. The snake is momentarily disoriented from its missed strike, giving you the perfect opportunity. You swing the stick again, this time with precise intent, aiming for the snake’s head.

     The stick connects with a powerful crack, striking the snake directly on its head. The force of the impact causes the snake to convulse violently. It hisses loudly, its movements becoming erratic. For a moment, it seems stunned, but you know you need to ensure it's incapacitated.

     The snake's movements slow, and its once-threatening posture collapses. Its head droops, and it becomes clear that the fight is almost over. You remain vigilant, watching carefully for any last attempts at retaliation.

** hyena **
    1 **
     The hyena, with its ragged fur and powerful jaws, circles you with a predatory gleam in its eyes. Its teeth are bared, and it snarls aggressively, clearly intent on claiming the carcass and you as its prey. You can see that it’s not alone—a pack might be nearby, and it’s clear you need to act quickly.

    attack, 2 **
     As the hyena lunges toward you, you swing the branch with all your might, aiming to strike it on the side. The branch connects with a resounding thud, knocking the hyena back and making it yelp in pain. The beast recoils but quickly regains its footing, snarling and baring its teeth. 

     You then took a deep breath, making yourself appear as large and imposing as possible. You raise the branch high above your head, shouting loudly and swinging it in a wide arc to create the illusion of greater threat.

     The hyena pauses, its eyes widening as it takes in your aggressive stance. It growls lowly, hesitant for a moment as if unsure whether to continue the attack. The beast’s posture becomes less aggressive, its ears flicking back as it assesses the new danger you’ve presented.

     As the hyena edges back, you lunge forward with a sudden, powerful thrust. The stick pierces through the hyena’s neck with a sickening crunch, the animal’s eyes widening in shock. It lets out a final, strangled cry as it collapses to the ground, its body twitching and convulsing before becoming still.

    defend, 3 **
     As you continue to make yourself look as menacing as possible, the hyena’s growls grow quieter, and it begins to back away, its gaze never leaving you. The standoff seems to stretch on, the tension palpable. Finally, the hyena turns and retreats into the jungle, vanishing into the dense foliage.

    attack, 4 **

** bear **
    1 **
     You were catching your breath after your brutal encounter with the hyena. The jungle is unusually quiet now, a stark contrast to the earlier chaos. As you stood over the fallen hyena, you heard a deep, rumbling growl that sends a chill down your spine. The ground trembles slightly, and a heavy silence envelops the clearing.

     The low, guttural roar grows louder, echoing through the trees and shaking the underbrush. Your instincts kick in, and you quickly realized that the sound is not a distant threat—it’s approaching fast. The massive bear that has been drawn to the clearing by the commotion emerges from the jungle, its eyes locked onto you with a deadly intent.

     The bear, a towering figure with powerful limbs and a coat of matted fur, strides into the clearing. Its breath is heavy and labored, and it emits another growl that reverberates through the air. The clearing, once a scene of victory, is now the stage for a fight with one of the jungle’s most fearsome predators.

     The bear's eyes are fixed on you, its powerful jaws slightly open, revealing sharp teeth. It seems enraged, either by the scent of blood from the hyena or by the intrusion into its territory. Its stance is aggressive, and it begins to charge toward you with a terrifying speed.

     The bear, now enraged and wary of your attack, roars loudly and charges again with renewed ferocity. Its massive claws swipe through the air, and its powerful jaws snap shut with a terrifying force.

     Realizing that you need to gain an advantage, you quickly scan the clearing for anything that could help. Nearby, you spot a pile of fallen branches and some large rocks scattered around.

     With the bear momentarily distracted by your previous strikes, you grab a couple of rocks and throw them towards a cluster of dense bushes. The sound of the rocks hitting the foliage creates a loud crash, drawing the bear’s attention.

     The bear turns towards the noise, growling and sniffing the air in curiosity. This brief diversion gives you a crucial opportunity to reposition yourself. You use the chance to move to a more defensible spot behind a large tree, where you can better shield yourself from the bear’s attacks.

    attack, 6 **
     The bear’s claws slice through the air with a forceful whoosh and connect with the tree behind you. The impact causes a shower of splinters as the tree’s bark is shredded, and the bear lets out a frustrated roar, its claws embedded in the wood for a moment before it retracts them.

     The bear pulls back, growling angrily as it shakes its paws, dislodging fragments of bark. Its eyes are still fixed on you, its rage undiminished despite the failed attack. The clearing remains tense, the battle far from over, but you’ve managed to avoid serious injury.
